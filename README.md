3. **ESP8266 WiFi Relay Selector** || RemoteXY Internet of Things‚ÄîHome Automation: https://youtu.be/bQO3b9l-Pb0

The 4-channel relay selector switch, controlled by the ESP8266 NodeMCU, is suitable for smart homes and Internet of Things (IoT) projects. The RemoteXY Selector Switch and Selector Options were configured to control the 4-channel relay module using the ESP8266 selectively. The ESP8266 is inserted into an ESP8266 NodeMCU breakout adapter board and connected to a 4-channel relay module. The RemoteXY web interface generates the Arduino code, and the Arduino IDE is used to program the code to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. The RemoteXY mobile app controls the ESP8266 NodeMCU - 4-channel relays to selectively switch them on/off.

The RemoteXY Edit field control sends analog data (integer and floating point) and text (strings) data from a smartphone app to the microcontroller (ESP8266 NodeMCU). The slider control sends analog data (0 - 100) to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. The control interface was created with the RemoteXY web application, which was used to generate the Arduino Code. The Arduino Code is copied to the Arduino IDE and modified to display the data on an I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The modified Arduino Code is uploaded to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. An I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is connected to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. Thus, the RemoteXY app on a smartphone sends analog data through the ESP8266 NodeMCU to display the data on an I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).

5. **Turn Your Phone into a Servo Motor Controller** || RemoteXY Internet of Things‚ÄîHome Automation: https://youtu.be/8baL-NywbS0

The RemoteXY joystick control sends Y and Y coordinates analog data (between -100 and 100 inclusive integer) from a smartphone app to the microcontroller (ESP8266 NodeMCU). The control interface was created with the RemoteXY web application, which was used to generate the Arduino Code. The Arduino Code is copied to the Arduino IDE and modified to first display the data on an I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The modified Arduino Code is uploaded to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. An I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is connected to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. Thus, the RemoteXY app on a smartphone sends analog data through the ESP8266 NodeMCU to display the data on an I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The Arduino sketch was later modified to control the S90 servo motors. Two servo motors were connected to the ESP8266 NodeMCU, and the RemoteXY app joystick control could operate the servo motors.

6. **Change Room Light Colors with ESP8266 + Smartphone** || RemoteXY Internet of Things‚ÄîHome Automation: https://youtu.be/TchVnWQotTI

‚ú® Change your room light colors using ESP8266 and your smartphone! In this IoT project, I used the RemoteXY app in conjunction with an ESP8266 NodeMCU to control an RGB LED (or LED strip) and create a real-time ambient mood lighting. With the Arduino IDE and RemoteXY‚Äôs RGB Color control, your phone sends color values over Wi-Fi to the ESP8266, which updates the LED using analogWrite. This setup works with both common anode and common cathode RGB LEDs, making it easy to adapt for LED strips or smart lamps.

üì± Monitor ESP8266 input status on your smartphone with RemoteXY! Learn how to track buttons, switches & sensors in real-time using Arduino IDE + Wi-Fi. #ESP8266 #IoT

In this IoT project, I show how to use the RemoteXY app with ESP8266 NodeMCU to display real-time input states like push buttons, switches, or sensors on your phone. This is a simple but powerful way to build smart home monitoring systems.

Using Arduino IDE and RemoteXY LED indication, the ESP8266 can track inputs (D5‚ÄìD8) and send their status over Wi-Fi. You‚Äôll learn how to configure multiple inputs with pull-up resistors, set LED indicators for each input, and even create a single multi-state LED with custom colors and blink intervals.


8. **How to Make a Color Detector with ESP8266 + RemoteXY!** || RemoteXY Internet of Things‚ÄîHome Automation: https://youtu.be/pk-ZltnRSfg

üì±Build a Smart RGB LED Color Detector with ESP8266 NodeMCU, TCS230 color sensor, and RemoteXY. üåà Detect colours in real time and light up an RGB LED while viewing live RGB values on your phone!

In this step-by-step tutorial, we‚Äôll build a smart RGB LED colour detector using the ESP8266 NodeMCU, the TCS230/TCS3200 colour sensor, and a 4-pin RGB LED. This project combines IoT with ESP8266, Arduino coding, and sensor-based electronics to detect colours and display them instantly on an LED and in the RemoteXY app dashboard.

When you place a red, green, or blue object in front of the TCS230 colour sensor, the ESP8266 processes the data and lights up the RGB LED with the detected shade. At the same time, the RemoteXY ESP8266 interface shows the RGB values live on your smartphone ‚Äî no custom app coding required.
