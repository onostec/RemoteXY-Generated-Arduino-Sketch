The 4-channel relay selector switch, controlled by the ESP8266 NodeMCU, is suitable for smart homes and Internet of Things (IoT) projects. The RemoteXY Selector Switch and Selector Options were configured to control the 4-channel relay module using the ESP8266 selectively. The ESP8266 is inserted into an ESP8266 NodeMCU breakout adapter board and connected to a 4-channel relay module. The RemoteXY web interface generates the Arduino code, and the Arduino IDE is used to program the code to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. The RemoteXY mobile app controls the ESP8266 NodeMCU - 4-channel relays to selectively switch them on/off.

The RemoteXY Edit field control sends analog data (integer and floating point) and text (strings) data from a smartphone app to the microcontroller (ESP8266 NodeMCU). The slider control sends analog data (0 - 100) to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. The control interface was created with the RemoteXY web application, which was used to generate the Arduino Code. The Arduino Code is copied to the Arduino IDE and modified to display the data on an I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display). The modified Arduino Code is uploaded to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. An I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is connected to the ESP8266 NodeMCU. Thus, the RemoteXY app on a smartphone sends analog data through the ESP8266 NodeMCU to display the data on an I2C LCD (Liquid Crystal Display).
